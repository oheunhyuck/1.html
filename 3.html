  <strong><u>JavaScript</u></strong> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS,
   is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core
technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables
 interactive web pages and is an essential part of web
  applications. The vast majority of websites use it for
  client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browser
  s have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
