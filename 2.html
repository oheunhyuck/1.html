<p><strong><u>Cascading Style Sheets</u></strong>(CSS) is a style sheet language used for
 describing the presentation of a document written in a marku
 p language like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
 content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
  separation can improve content accessibility, provide more
  flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
   characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share
    formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
     .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the
      structural content as well as enabling the .css file to
       be cached to improve the page load speed between the
        pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
